      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Our teacher assigned us a project about Lizzie Velasquez. She has this
        rare syndrome that prevents her from gaining weight. In the video she
        showed us, Lizzie talked about the challenges she faced while growing up
        and the daily struggles she continues to endure. She also shared some
        valuable insights on how to find purpose in life, regardless of your
        appearance or the obstacles you encounter. It was a pretty eye-opening
        experience, to be honest.

      <h1>Rhetorical Devices</h1>
      <p>
        <u>Irony</u> - Lizzie Velasquez uses irony when she mentions that some
        people wonder how there could be benefits to her condition, like only
        being able to see out of one eye. This ironic statement challenges
        stereotypes and expectations, prompting the audience to reconsider their
        assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Hyperbole</u> - Lizzie Velasquez exaggerates her roommate's
        observation about her late-night snacking by saying, "I could hear you
        at 12:30 reaching under your bed to get food." This exaggeration adds
        humor and emphasizes her point about eating habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Metaphor</u> - When describing her backpack, which looked like a
        "turtle shell," Lizzie Velasquez uses a metaphor to vividly convey its
        size and her small stature. This helps the audience visualize her
        childhood experiences.
