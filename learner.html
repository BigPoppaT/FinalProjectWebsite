        Our teacher introduced us to the three types of learners: visual,
        auditory, and kinesthetic/tactile. For an assignment, we had to play
        three unfamiliar games—Scrabble, Jigsaw Puzzle, and Mahjong—and learn
        them independently. This activity revealed our learning preferences.
        After completing the games, our teacher quizzed us to determine our
        learning styles. Turns out, I'm a kinesthetic/tactile learner, which
        means I prefer hands-on practice to grasp concepts.
