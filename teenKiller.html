        <h1>Teen Killers and their Punishments</h1>
        <p>
          Our teacher assigned us an assignment about teen killers and their
          punishments. I read an article about a teenager who killed an innocent
          young girl just for the "thrill of killing someone." The article
          discussed the punishment he should receive and explained the whole
          situation. It's a pretty heavy topic to think about.

        <h1>Rhetorical Devices</h1>
        <p>
          Ethos (paragraph 2) - "Charles Stimson, a leading expert in criminal
          law at Heritage Foundations." - This is Ethos becuase he establishing
          authority and credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          Euphemism (paragraph 5) - "people of nothern Canada had no juvenlile
          crime at all until 1980 and the introduction of television into their
          culture" - The author easily couldve said that television brain washes
          kids into doing violent acts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Parallelism (paragraph 1) - "...crime even if we do nothing to
          <u>deter them</u>, while others will seek it out even if we do
          everthing to <u>reform them.</u>...<u>Wicked people</u>
          exist....except to set them apart from <u>innocent people."</u> - This
          shows parallelism by using two or more phrases or clauses in a
          sentence that have the same grammatical structure.
