        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Our teacher gave us this assignment, it was all about this song called
          "Jurassic 5." The deal was to dig into the lyrics and spot 20
          different rhetorical devices in there. Honestly, I wasn't super into
          the whole rhetorical devices thing before, but this task was a
          game-changer. It seriously helped me get a grip on what these devices
          are all about and how to find them not just in songs but in all sorts
          of texts.

        <h3>Rhetorical Devices</h3>
        <p>
          Alliteration (paragraph 1) - "Dont judge us by <u>bank</u> accounts
          and <u>big</u> cars. No matter how <u>bright</u> we shine we're far
          from <u>being</u> stars." - This is Alliteration because it repeats
          the initial constant letters (or sounds).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pathos (paragraph 2) - "Where hopes are blown, not even money for the
          phone. Now tell me what's the solution, how to get back home?" - This
          is pathos because the writer tries to invoke pity and sadness with
          that statement.
